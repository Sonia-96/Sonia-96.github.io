                <h4>Hi, I'm Sonia!</h4>
                <div>
                    <p> I got my B.S. in Chemistry at Peking University and used to be a Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry. 
                        After two-year's exploring, I found that Computer Science matches the most
                        with my study interest, career goal and life calling. So I quit my Ph.D. and decided to pursue a CS Master.</p>

                                <li>UN says it takes at least 100 years to close the gender gap. I hope I could be a positive catalyst in
                                    the process.</li>
