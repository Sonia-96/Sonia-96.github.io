                <h4>Hi, I'm Sonia!</h4>
                <div>
                    <p> I got my B.S. in Chemistry at Peking University and used to be a Chemistry Ph.D. student.
                        After three-year's exploration, I found that Computer Science matches the most
                        with my study interest, career goal and life's calling. Therefore, I shifted from my Ph.D. to
                        pursue a CS Master.</p>
                    <p> I aim to promote gender equality all my life. UN says it takes at least 100 years to close the gender gap. I hope I could be a
                        positive catalyst in the process.</p>
